#UnifDiag code

##Description
Code related to ICASSP 2018 paper "Streaming Binary Sketching Based on Subspace Tracking and Diagonal Uniformization".
This code shows how to uniformize the diagonal coefficients of a symmetric square matrix by a sequence of Givens rotation matrices.
In our application, it is used to uniformize the diagonal coefficients of the covariance matrix of projected data onto the first eigenvectors.

##TODO
Add further codes regarding experiments of the paper.
